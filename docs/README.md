# MMA Action Recognition with Pose Estimation and LSTMs

## Overview
This project is a master's capstone focused on classifying MMA actions from sparring footage using pose estimation and sequence modeling. A custom annotated dataset was created from MMA sparring videos and used to train an LSTM-based classifier.

The final model achieves **97% classification accuracy** on held-out test data.
